## INTRODUCTION

The aim of this project was to use high quality processes to build a ruby on rails full stack web application within a team.

The requirement was to build a facebook clone where a user can signup, write, update, and delete posts, and view posts from all users. In addition to the web application's user stories we were required to approach the build with the Agile project management methodology.

The project is provided by Makers Academy as week eight's group challenge; this provides the learning base for Ruby on Rails and the Agile project management process.

## TECH/FRAMEWORK USED

**Primary programming language:** *Ruby on Rails*, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

**Other programming languages:** *HTML/CSS/Javascript* is used for styling in the browser. Bootstrap has been used as our CSS framework.

**Unit testing framework:** *RSpec* is a Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby, run from the command line.

**Feature testing framework:** *Capybara* is used to test web applications by simulating how a real user would interact with your app. Runs off RSpec commands in the terminal.

**ORM:** *Active record* facilitates the creation and use of objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.

**CI/CD:** *Travis CI* is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub. It can also be used as part of the pipeline to automatic deployment on Heroku.

**Cloud platform:** *Heroku* is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
